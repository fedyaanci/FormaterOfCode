Compile programm and run it. This program converts pascal-string to program-string, etc do margins, spaces, so creates something beautiful.
Rules:
  1) Before integrated operators thera are two spaces
  2) There are no spaces before the closing parenthesis and after the opening one
  3) There is a space after the comma, before - not.
  4) Before BEGIN and END there aren't not spaces
  5) PASCAL-operators have upper register
  6) After '.' Everything is being rewritten.
Do not judge strictly, the program does not work with all operators, but only with the main ones :)
